<h3>R for Data Science</h3>
<p>Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund wrote an incredible book called <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html" target="_blank">R for Data Science (R4DS)</a>. In the book they teach how to “turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge.” The authors do this by being laser focused on the tools that help the data-practitioner import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model data (+communicate findings):</p>

</div>
<p>I dug into the chapter on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) this past week.</p>
<p>The chapter is 🔥 and I highly recommend it 😎</p>
</div>
<div id="exploring-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Exploring Data</h3>
<p>I was super excited about the chapter and the knowledge it packed!</p>
<p>In my own path to improving my EDA skills I thought I’d capture what stuck out most in the form of a blog post.</p>
</div>
<div id="eda-overview" class="section level3">
<h3>EDA Overview</h3>
<p>The authors of R4DS explain EDA as the process of “using visualization and transformation to <code>Explore</code> your <code>Data</code> in a systematic way.” They recommend an iterative cycle as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Generate <code>questions</code> about your data.</li>
<li>Search for <code>answers</code> by visualizing, transforming, and modeling your data.</li>
<li>Use what you learn to refine your <code>questions</code> and/or generate new <code>questions.</code></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="favorite-quotes-from-intro" class="section level3">
<h3>Favorite Quotes (from Intro)</h3>
<p>The chapter was packed full of content - here are the quotes that stood out the most from the Introduction:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“EDA is not a formal process with a strict set of rules.”</p></li>
<li><p>“EDA is a state of mind.” - I love this one 😎</p></li>
<li><p>“During the initial phases of EDA you should feel free to investigate every idea that occurs to you.”</p></li>
<li><p>“As your exploration continues, you will home in on a few particularly productive areas that you’ll eventually write up and communicate to others.”</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="questions-drive-eda" class="section level3">
<h3>Questions Drive EDA</h3>
<p>One of my biggest take always from the chapter was the emphasis on EDA being a creative process that is <code>driven by</code> asking <code>questions</code> - and lots of them 🤔</p>
</div>
<div id="section-on-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Section on Questions</h3>
<p>The section titled <code>Questions</code> was packed full of nuggets - here are a few of the quotes that stuck out:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“EDA is fundamentally a creative process.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Your goal during EDA is to develop an understanding of your data. The easiest way to do this is to use <code>questions</code> as tools to guide your investigation.”</p></li>
<li><p>“the key to asking quality <code>questions</code> is to generate a large quantity of <code>questions.</code>” - So Good 😎</p></li>
<li><p>“each new <code>question</code> that you ask will expose you to a new aspect of your data and increase your chance of making a discovery.”</p></li>
<li><p>“There is no rule about which <code>questions</code> you should ask to guide your research. However, two types of <code>questions</code> will always be useful for making discoveries within your data. You can loosely word these <code>questions</code> as:”</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What type of variation occurs within my variables?</li>
<li>What type of covariation occurs between my variables?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="section-on-variation" class="section level3">
<h3>Section on Variation</h3>
<p>We are always interested in discovering what explains the variation seen in data and so the section on <code>Variation</code> was very interesting. Here are a few of the quotes that stood out:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Variation is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from measurement to measurement.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Every variable has its own pattern of variation, which can reveal interesting information.”</p></li>
<li><p>“The best way to understand that pattern is to visualize the distribution of the variable’s values.”</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="visualizing-distributions" class="section level3">
<h3>Visualizing Distributions</h3>
<p>This post wouldn’t be complete without a bit of code and a few visualizations 🤓</p>

<h4>Categorical Variables</h4>
<ul>
<li>“To examine the distribution of a categorical variable, use a bar chart:”</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>p1 &lt;- ggplot(diamonds) +
    geom_bar(aes(x = cut)) +
    labs(title = &quot;Bar Charts for Categorical Variables&quot;)

</div>
<div id="continuous-variables" class="section level4">
<h4>Continuous Variables</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>“To examine the distribution of a continuous variable, use a histogram:”</p></li>
<li><p>“You can set the width of the intervals in a histogram with the <code>binwidth</code> argument, which is <code>measured in the units of the x variable</code>.”</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>p2 &lt;- ggplot(diamonds %&gt;% filter(carat &lt; 3)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = 1.0) +
    labs(title = &quot;Binwidth: 1.0&quot;) 

p3 &lt;- ggplot(diamonds %&gt;% filter(carat &lt; 3)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.5) +
    labs(title = &quot;Binwidth = 0.5&quot;) 

p4 &lt;- ggplot(diamonds %&gt;% filter(carat &lt; 3)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.1) +
    labs(title = &quot;Binwidth = 0.1&quot;) 

p5 &lt;- ggplot(diamonds %&gt;% filter(carat &lt; 3)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.01) +
    labs(title = &quot;Binwidth = 0.01&quot;) </code></pre>
<ul>
<li>“You should always <code>explore a variety of binwidths</code> when working with histograms, as different binwidths can reveal different patterns.”</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># Show plots
patchwork &lt;- p2 + p3 + p4 + p5

patchwork + plot_annotation(
  title   = &quot;Histograms for Continuous Variables&quot;,
  caption = &quot;Notice the different patterns that are revealed.&quot;
)</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="typical-values" class="section level3">
<h3>Typical Values</h3>
<p>Remember how the author’s emphasize the use of <code>questions</code> to drive EDA?</p>
<p>This section on <code>Typical</code> <code>Values</code> continues that thread and suggests the following <code>questions</code> to ask when <code>Visualizing</code> <code>Distributions</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Which values are the most common? Why?”</p></li>
<li><p>“Which values are rare? Why? Does that match your expectations?”</p></li>
<li><p>“Can you see any unusual patterns? What might explain them?”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Another learning from this section is to focus on the clusters revealed when <code>Visualizing</code> your <code>Distributions.</code> For example, take a look at the <code>Histogram</code> using a <code>Binwidth</code> of <code>0.01</code>; obvious clusters are revealed that are not obvious in the other 3 plots.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p5</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-06-20-exploratory-data-analysis-eda-guide_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The author’s point out that “clusters of similar values suggest that subgroups exist in your data.”</p>
<p>What do you think they suggest doing in this situation? Ask more <code>questions</code> 🤔</p>
<p>Understand the subgroups by asking:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“How are the observations within each cluster similar to each other?”</p></li>
<li><p>“How are the observations in separate clusters different from each other?”</p></li>
<li><p>“How can you explain or describe the clusters?”</p></li>
<li><p>“Why might the appearance of clusters be misleading?”</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="wrap-up" class="section level3">
<h3>Wrap Up</h3>
<p>The chapter goes on to discuss unusual values, missing values, covariation, and briefly goes into using models to further your EDA. I highly recommend giving it a read and trying out the exercises in the chapter.</p>
<p>Get the code here: <a href="https://github.com/dexters-analytics/data_blog/tree/master/content/post" target="_blank">Github Repo</a>.</p>
<p><code>Questions.</code> <code>Questions.</code> <code>Questions.</code></p>
<p>The biggest learning I took from this chapter, and what I’ve started using in my own EDA process, is getting better at asking <code>questions.</code> Not only that, but really to let my curiosity drive the EDA early on in the process.</p>
<p>And my favorite quote is probably this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the key to asking quality questions is to generate a large quantity of questions.”</p>
</blockquote>
