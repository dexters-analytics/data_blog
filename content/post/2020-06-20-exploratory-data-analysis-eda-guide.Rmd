### Quick Overview

Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund wrote an incredible book called [R for Data Science (R4DS)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html){target="_blank"}. In the book they teach how to "turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge." The authors do this by being laser focused on the tools that help the data-practitioner import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model data (+communicate findings):

I dug into the chapter on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) this past week. 

The chapter is 🔥 and I highly recommend it 😎

### Exploring Data

I was super excited about the chapter and the knowledge it packed!

In my own path to improving my EDA skills I thought I'd capture what stuck out most in the form of a blog post.

### EDA Overview

The authors of R4DS explain EDA as the process of "using visualization and transformation to `Explore` your `Data` in a systematic way." They recommend an iterative cycle as follows:

> 1. Generate `questions` about your data.
> 2. Search for `answers` by visualizing, transforming, and modeling your data.
> 3. Use what you learn to refine your `questions` and/or generate new `questions.`


### Favorite Quotes (from Intro)

The chapter was packed full of content - here are the quotes that stood out the most from the Introduction:

* "EDA is not a formal process with a strict set of rules."

* "EDA is a state of mind." - I love this one 😎

* "During the initial phases of EDA you should feel free to investigate every idea that occurs to you."

* "As your exploration continues, you will home in on a few particularly productive areas that you’ll eventually write up and communicate to others."


### Questions Drive EDA

One of my biggest take always from the chapter was the emphasis on EDA being a creative process that is `driven by` asking `questions` - and lots of them 🤔

### Section on Questions

The section titled `Questions` was packed full of nuggets - here are a few of the quotes that stuck out:

* "EDA is fundamentally a creative process."

* "Your goal during EDA is to develop an understanding of your data. The easiest way to do this is to use `questions` as tools to guide your investigation."

* "the key to asking quality `questions` is to generate a large quantity of `questions.`" - So Good 😎

* "each new `question` that you ask will expose you to a new aspect of your data and increase your chance of making a discovery."

* "There is no rule about which `questions` you should ask to guide your research. However, two types of `questions` will always be useful for making discoveries within your data. You can loosely word these `questions` as:"

> 1. What type of variation occurs within my variables?
> 2. What type of covariation occurs between my variables?


### Section on Variation

We are always interested in discovering what explains the variation seen in data and so the section on `Variation` was very interesting. Here are a few of the quotes that stood out:

* "Variation is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from measurement to measurement."

* "Every variable has its own pattern of variation, which can reveal interesting information."

* "The best way to understand that pattern is to visualize the distribution of the variable’s values."

### Visualizing Distributions

This post wouldn't be complete without a bit of code and a few visualizations 🤓

#### Categorical Variables

* "To examine the distribution of a categorical variable, use a bar chart:"

```{r, fig.height=3}
p1 <- ggplot(diamonds) +
    geom_bar(aes(x = cut)) +
    labs(title = "Bar Charts for Categorical Variables")
p1
```

#### Continuous Variables

* "To examine the distribution of a continuous variable, use a histogram:"

* "You can set the width of the intervals in a histogram with the `binwidth` argument, which is `measured in the units of the x variable`."

```{r}
p2 <- ggplot(diamonds %>% filter(carat < 3)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = 1.0) +
    labs(title = "Binwidth: 1.0") 

p3 <- ggplot(diamonds %>% filter(carat < 3)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.5) +
    labs(title = "Binwidth = 0.5") 

p4 <- ggplot(diamonds %>% filter(carat < 3)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.1) +
    labs(title = "Binwidth = 0.1") 

p5 <- ggplot(diamonds %>% filter(carat < 3)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.01) +
    labs(title = "Binwidth = 0.01") 
```

* "You should always `explore a variety of binwidths` when working with histograms, as different binwidths can reveal different patterns."

```{r}
# Show plots
patchwork <- p2 + p3 + p4 + p5

patchwork + plot_annotation(
  title   = "Histograms for Continuous Variables",
  caption = "Notice the different patterns that are revealed."
)
```

### Typical Values

Remember how the author's emphasize the use of `questions` to drive EDA? 

This section on `Typical` `Values` continues that thread and suggests the following `questions` to ask when `Visualizing` `Distributions`:

* "Which values are the most common? Why?"

* "Which values are rare? Why? Does that match your expectations?"

* "Can you see any unusual patterns? What might explain them?"

Another learning from this section is to focus on the clusters revealed when `Visualizing` your `Distributions.` For example, take a look at the `Histogram` using a `Binwidth` of `0.01`; obvious clusters are revealed that are not obvious in the other 3 plots.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, fig.align='center'}
p5
```


The author's point out that "clusters of similar values suggest that subgroups exist in your data."

What do you think they suggest doing in this situation? Ask more `questions` 🤔

Understand the subgroups by asking:

* "How are the observations within each cluster similar to each other?"

* "How are the observations in separate clusters different from each other?"

* "How can you explain or describe the clusters?"

* "Why might the appearance of clusters be misleading?"

### Wrap Up

The chapter goes on to discuss unusual values, missing values, covariation, and briefly goes into using models to further your EDA. I highly recommend giving it a read and trying out the exercises in the chapter.

`Questions.` `Questions.` `Questions.`

The biggest learning I took from this chapter, and what I've started using in my own EDA process, is getting better at asking `questions.` Not only that, but really to let my curiosity drive the EDA early on in the process.

And my favorite quote is probably this one: 

> “the key to asking quality questions is to generate a large quantity of questions.” 

### Watch an Expert do EDA

This is a quick bonus for making it this far in the post.

David Robinson is an expert when it comes to all things `EDA` and `R`. For the last year or so he has been recording weekly screencasts where he `Explores` `Data` he has never seen before.

I watch these videos often to get insights into how to think analytically when doing EDA.

You can check them out here at his YouTube channel: [Tidy Tuesday R Screencasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL19ev-r1GBwkuyiwnxoHTRC8TTqP8OEi8){target="_blank"}

### Learn R Quickly

I've expedited my `R` and `Data-Science` journey using the courses over at [Business Science University](https://www.business-science.io/?affcode=173166_vnvxtqbd){target="_blank"}
