### Series: Exploring R {packages}

This is the 2nd post in the new series on `Exploring` `R` `{packages}`.

I have a habit of finding one or two useful `functions` in a `{package}`, but rarely explore further to discover other useful functionality.

In this series I'm testing the idea of breaking that habit and sharing what I learn along the way.

In each post, I will share a bit about how I was using a `{package}`and then use a case-study to highlight other `functionality` I discovered to be useful.


### DataExplorer {package}

You can tell by the name of my blog that `{DataExplorer}` is perfectly suited for this series on `R``{packages}`.

[Boxuan Cui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/boxuancui/){target="_blank"} is the developer and maintainer of the `package` and at it's core is designed to "simplify and automate EDA." 

Take the time to explore the [Github Page](http://boxuancui.github.io/DataExplorer/){target="_blank"} for the `{DataExplorer::package}`, where Sam describes it as follow:

> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the initial and an important phase of data analysis/predictive modeling. During this process, analysts/modelers will have a first look of the data, and thus generate relevant hypotheses and decide next steps. However, the EDA process could be a hassle at times. This R package aims to automate most of data handling and visualization, so that users could focus on studying the data and extracting insights.

Just about every time I'm working with new data, I'm loading `{DataExplorer}` from my library of `R` `{packages}`.

However, I'm typically only using the `plot_missing()` function.

While `Exploring` the `package` further I was excited to discover `functionality` that is now part of my EDA toolbox 🧰


### Case-Study

The case-study will provide and illustrate the following:

1. The `function` I use often: `DataExplorer::plot_missing()`.
2. Newly discovered `functions` from `{DataExplorer}`.  


### Load Packages

```{r}
# Core Packages
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyquant)
library(knitr)

# Data Cleaning
library(janitor)

# EDA
library(skimr)
library(DataExplorer)
library(correlationfunnel)

# ggplot2 Helpers
library(scales)

# Geographic
library(countrycode)
```


### Import Data

```{r}
# tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 28)
# coffee_ratings <- tuesdata$coffee_ratings

#coffee_ratings_tbl <- read_csv("static/01_data/coffee_ratings.csv")
coffee_ratings_tbl <- read_csv("../../static/01_data/coffee_ratings.csv")

```


### Data Understanding

Set up preprocessing pipeline (we will build on it)

Initial investigation made it clear to remove some cols


### Data Analysis (exploration)

```{r}


coffee_rating_preprocessed_tbl <- coffee_ratings_tbl %>% 
  
  # drop unnecessary columns
  select(-in_country_partner, -contains("certification")) %>% 
    
  # add unique id
  mutate(id = row_number())  
  
skim(coffee_rating_preprocessed_tbl)

coffee_rating_preprocessed_tbl %>% plot_missing()
coffee_rating_preprocessed_tbl %>% plot_bar(maxcat = 50, ncol = 2, nrow = 2, ggtheme = theme_tq())
coffee_rating_preprocessed_tbl %>% plot_histogram(ncol = 3, nrow = 2, ggtheme = theme_tq())
```



### Data Understanding


### Exploratory Data Analysis


### Preprocessing Data Pipeline

Bringing it all together from what we've learning

```{r}
# # reminder of raw-data
# raw_data
# 
# # reminder of preprocessing/cleaning
# data_processed
# 
# # setup recipe based on eda findings
# preprocessing_recipe
# 
# # add recipe to preprocessing data pipeline
# data_processed
```
