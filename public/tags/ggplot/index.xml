Quick Overview Recently, I completed the Data Science for Business 101 course over at Business Science University. In the course, Matt Dancho teaches students the fundamentals of data science for business with the tidyverse.
The course is jam packed with material: from basic data wrangling all the way to applied machine learning - I highly recommend it to anyone looking to advance their skills 🤓</description>

Let’s Dive Into an Example I’d like to share a technique using str_glue() that I learned from Matt Dancho, a Data-Science instructor at Business Science University. Check out my favorite course here: Business Analysis With R.
str_glue() from the stringr library is one of my favorite functions in R - It’s super helpful for wrangling and manipulating text in preparation for building advanced plots.</description>
