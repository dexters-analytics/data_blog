      <description>Let’s Dive Into an Example I’d like to share a technique using str_glue() that I learned from Matt Dancho, a Data-Science instructor at Business Science University. Check out my favorite course here: Business Analysis With R.
str_glue() from the stringr library is one of my favorite functions in R - It’s super helpful for wrangling and manipulating text in preparation for building advanced plots.
