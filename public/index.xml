      <description>Let’s Dive Into an Example I’d like to share a technique using str_glue() that I learned from Matt Dancho, a Data-Science instructor at Business Science University. Check out my favorite course here: Business Analysis With R.
str_glue() from the stringr library is one of my favorite functions in R - It’s super helpful for wrangling and manipulating text in preparation for building advanced plots.
 Let’s Get Some Data 🤓 The Tidy Tuesday Project is an awesome repository of useful data for practicing your data Wrangling skills.</description>

      <description>CONTEXT My name is Jason Dexter and I&amp;rsquo;m an R-Programmer and Data-Analyst based out of Berkeley, CA, where I live with my lovely wife 💃 and our two cats 🐈 🐈
In graduate school I was introduced to programming, first base-R then Python. The idea 💡 of solving problems programmatically resonated deeply with me and I&amp;rsquo;ve been hooked ever since.
I&amp;rsquo;m a nerd 🤓 when it comes to automating data manipulation - there&amp;rsquo;s something intoxicating about the process of wrangling data using code, it&amp;rsquo;s simply amazing!</description>
